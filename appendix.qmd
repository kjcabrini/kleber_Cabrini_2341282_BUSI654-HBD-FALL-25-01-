## ✍️ Commentary – What I Used and Edited

I used the LLM output as inspiration to:
- Structure the layout (bio, experience, skills, etc.)
- Draft the initial text for my summary and skills
- Adapt Bootstrap icons and Google Translate suggestion

All final text was revised and rewritten in my own voice for authenticity and accuracy.
